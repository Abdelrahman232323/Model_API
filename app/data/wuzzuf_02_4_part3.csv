 Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all. 
 We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! 
 But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) 
 Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

 If you have an interest in quantity surveying and would like to build up your skills with the chance of working with a leading UK measurement company, what we are offering might be for you. 
 Our proposal works like this. Every year we find, train and employ junior quantity surveyors in Egypt. This year we’ve decided to upgrade the first 10 days of the online training that we provide and offer it as a FREE course to new candidates. A few of those who complete the course will be offered a place in one of our internship programs. Some of those on the internship program will be offered a job. 
 The course is designed to assist anyone who is interested in QS work regardless of whether they want to work with us or not. 
 The FREE Online Junior Quantity Surveyor (JQS) Course 
 The course is provided in an online format that is designed to be both informative and entertaining. The idea is that we assist you in gaining valuable knowledge. The causes offer: 
 10 days of self-paced learning in which you will be assessed on a module by module basis. Due to the number of courses, most support will be provided from a distance (without much direct human interaction) 
 Your progress will be entirely based on your own commitment to learning. A range of ideas is provided to assist you in accelerating your learning skills. 
 On Day One, in the “Is this course for you” module, we will learn about each other.  You will learn about TSA, and we will learn about you. By the end of this day, we should have a clearer understanding of whether you are a good fit for the role, and vice versa. 
 Modules are designed to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Subject areas are considered from two perspectives: a wider industry perspective and how it is that TSA Ltd overcomes the challenges and risks that are inherited in the work. 
 Subjects covered are those that are essential to the industry. The industry standards and the aptitudes, skills, techniques that are required in this profession. 
 How changes in technology are changing the industry together with how TSA Ltd are using and developing technology and AI to assist them in meeting the needs of Main Contractors working on major projects. 
 The course itself is a mixed media approach involving videos, PowerPoint Presentations, reading, Q&A, exercises, etc. 
 We will from day one be giving you feedback as to your progress and whether we think you would be a suitable candidate for the kind of work we do. Regardless of how your progress is, you will be welcomed to complete the whole course. 
 A few words of warning: 
 TSA Ltd is a specialist in Measurement and Production of Bills of Quantities. The course has been developed to highlight the importance of this aspect in a quantity surveyor’s work. If your interest is specialising in costs or work planning this course might not be for you. 
 Some aspects of a JQS’s role are challenging, so you need to ask yourself whether you want to be challenged. For example, you will be asked to read and make sense of a fair bit of written material - if you’re not a fan of reading, this may not be the right opportunity for you. 
 Lastly, we only ever employ people who like doing the work of a JQS. So if you find that you don’t like the exercises that we give you on the course, enjoy the experience, take the knowledge and pick a career to which you are better suited. 
 The number of candidates that can be invited into the internship programs is limited. Therefore, you should probably only do the course if you want the knowledge for its own sake (and not do the course in the hope that you will get an internship). 
 0.1 The Internship Programs 
 For a lucky few, the internship program is as follows: 
 After completing the free course, a two successive 
 one-month online internships
